        <p>My Mission</p>
        <p>
          I am a Software Engineering Technology (AI) student at Centennial College, 
          passionate about building reliable and efficient applications with 
          JavaScript, React, and C#. My focus is on clean design and readable code, 
          while applying problem-solving skills to real projects like payroll systems, 
          car dealership apps, and AI-assisted learning tools.
